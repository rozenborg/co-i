### Code Walkthrough Session - Configuration Module

| Status | Concept | Description | Example from Code |
|:------:|---------|-------------|------------------|
| ✔︎ | **Type Hints** | "Spellcheck for code" - tells IDE/tools what data types to expect | `Optional[str]`, `Dict[str, bool]` |
| ✔︎ | **Dataclasses** | Automatic generation of common methods for data-storing classes | `@dataclass` decorator on `AppConfig` |
| ✔︎ | **Path Objects** | Modern, object-oriented file path handling (cross-platform) | `Path(env_file).exists()` |
| ✔︎ | **Graceful Dependencies** | Making optional packages truly optional with try/except | `try: from dotenv import load_dotenv except ImportError: load_dotenv = None` |
| ✔︎ | **Environment Variables** | OS-level key-value storage for configuration | `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")` |
| ✔︎ | **.env Files** | Local file for storing environment variables (via python-dotenv) | Loads from `.env` automatically |
| ✔︎ | **Configuration Classes** | Single source of truth for app settings using dataclasses | `@dataclass class AppConfig` with all settings |
| ✔︎ | **Clear Contracts** | Predictable interfaces - what code expects (inputs) and provides (outputs) | `AIResponse` always has same fields regardless of provider |
| ✔︎ | **AI Model Parameters** | Standard knobs/dials for AI behavior (creativity, length, timeouts) | `temperature=0.7`, `max_tokens=150`, `request_timeout=30` |
| ✔︎ | **Environment Modes** | Deployment stage indicators (development/staging/production) | `environment: str = "development"` |
| ✔︎ | **Return Type Hints** | Promise what type of object a function will return | `def load_config() -> AppConfig:` |
| ✔︎ | **Configuration Loading** | Creating config objects from environment variables with defaults | `os.getenv("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO")` |
| ✔︎ | **Type Conversion** | Converting string environment variables to proper Python types | `float(os.getenv("TEMP", "0.7"))`, `bool() conversion` |
| ✔︎ | **String-to-Boolean Logic** | Converting string env vars to booleans with case handling | `os.getenv("DEBUG", "false").lower() == "true"` |
| ✔︎ | **Provider Availability** | Checking which services are configured and ready to use | `{"openai": bool(config.api_key)}` |
| ✔︎ | **Configuration Validation** | Fail-fast principle - catch config errors at startup, not runtime | `raise ValueError` if invalid settings |
| ✔︎ | **Dynamic Attribute Access** | Getting object attributes using string names instead of direct access | `getattr(logging, "INFO")` vs `logging.INFO` |
| ✔︎ | **sys vs os Modules** | sys=Python runtime (stdout, exit), os=Operating system (env vars, files) | `sys.stdout` vs `os.getenv()` |
| ✔︎ | **Logger Hierarchy** | Parent-child relationship for organized logging control | Root → coi → coi.providers → coi.utils |
| ✔︎ | **Logging Handlers** | Objects that determine WHERE logs go (console, file, etc.) | `StreamHandler(sys.stdout)`, `FileHandler(path)` |
| ✔︎ | **Safe List Modification** | Using slice copy to safely modify list during iteration | `for item in list[:]` pattern |
| ✔︎ | **Path Operations** | Creating directories with parent creation and error handling | `path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` |
| ✔︎ | **Module Name Variable** | Built-in variable containing current module's dot-notation name | `__name__` = "coi.utils.logging" |
| ✔︎ | **Object Registry Pattern** | System maintaining collection of named objects for reuse | Python's internal logger registry |
| ✔︎ | **Abstract Base Classes** | Classes that define contracts other classes must implement | `class BaseProvider(ABC)` with `@abstractmethod` |
| ✔︎ | **Interface Contracts** | Forcing different implementations through same method signatures | All providers must have `generate()`, `get_available_models()` etc. |
| ✔︎ | **Instance Variables** | Object attributes created during initialization to store data | `self.config = config` creates provider.config |
| ✔︎ | **String Representation** | Method controlling how objects appear when printed/displayed | `__repr__()` auto-generated by `@dataclass` |
| ✔︎ | **Private Methods** | Functions prefixed with _ indicating internal use only | `_validate_config()` not meant for external calls |
| ✔︎ | **Method Inheritance** | Child classes calling parent class methods via super() | `super().__init__()` calls Exception's init method |
| ✔︎ | **Custom Exception Hierarchy** | Creating specific error types that inherit from base exceptions | RateLimitError → ProviderError → Exception |
| ✔︎ | **Error Classification** | Using specific exception types as organizational labels | Empty classes with `pass` used for categorization |
| ✔︎ | **Package Public Interface** | Controlling what external code can import from a package | `__all__ = ["BaseProvider"]` limits external imports |
| ✔︎ | **Package vs Module Access** | Internal modules can see each other, external code limited by __all__ | Within package: full access, outside: restricted |
| ✔︎ | **Python Package Structure** | __init__.py files turn folders into importable packages | Folder + __init__.py = package with controlled interface |
| ✔︎ | **Keyword Arguments (kwargs)** | Accepting unlimited named parameters with **kwargs | `**kwargs` collects extra parameters into dictionary |
| ✔︎ | **Async Functions** | Non-blocking functions that don't freeze your app | `async def` and `await` for concurrent operations |
| ✔︎ | **API Response Standardization** | Converting provider-specific responses to common format | OpenAI response → AIResponse with consistent fields |
| ✔︎ | **Error Mapping** | Translating provider-specific errors to standardized exceptions | `OpenAIRateLimitError` → `RateLimitError` |
| ✔︎ | **Exception Chaining** | Catching specific errors and raising custom ones with context | `except OpenAIError as e: raise CustomError(str(e))` |
| ✔︎ | **Exponential Backoff** | Retry failed operations with increasing delays | Wait 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s between retry attempts |
| ✔︎ | **Client Configuration** | Building API client parameters conditionally | Add optional fields to config dict if they exist |
| ✔︎ | **Token Usage Tracking** | Monitoring API costs via input/output token counts | `usage.prompt_tokens`, `usage.completion_tokens` |
| ✔︎ | **Main Entry Point Pattern** | Using `if __name__ == "__main__":` to control script execution | Only run main() when file executed directly, not imported |
| ✔︎ | **Python Path Manipulation** | Adding directories to sys.path for module discovery | `sys.path.insert(0, "src")` for importing local packages |
| ✔︎ | **Mock Testing** | Using fake objects to test without external dependencies | `unittest.mock` for testing without API calls or costs |
| ✔︎ | **Test Assertions** | Using assert statements to validate expected behavior | `assert config.api_key == "test-key"` |
| ✔︎ | **Context Managers (with)** | Temporarily replacing objects during tests | `with patch(...)` temporarily swaps real objects with fakes |
| ✔︎ | **Build Systems vs Dependencies** | Understanding packaging tools vs runtime requirements | setuptools/wheel for building vs openai/requests for running |
| ✔︎ | **Python Packaging** | setuptools builds packages, wheel creates .whl files | Tools that make `pip install` possible |
| ✔︎ | **Development Tooling** | Code quality tools: formatters, linters, type checkers | black, isort, mypy, pytest configured in pyproject.toml |
| ✔︎ | **Test Coverage** | Measuring how much code is tested and excluding irrelevant lines | coverage.py tracks tested vs untested code |
| ✔︎ | **Generated vs Source Files** | Understanding which files are created by tools vs written by developers | htmlcov/, .coverage, .pytest_cache/ are generated |

### Assessment Notes
- **Type hints** ✔︎ - Solid grasp of concept as "spellcheck for code"
- **Dataclasses** ✔︎ - Understood the boilerplate reduction well  
- **Path Objects** ⚠️ - Good start, but more about path manipulation than just "creating objects"
- **Environment Variables** ✔︎ - Asked great follow-up questions about system vs venv scope
- **.env Files** ✔︎ - Clear understanding of purpose and relationship to environment variables
- **Graceful Dependencies** 📋 - Just encountered, need to explain back to assess understanding
