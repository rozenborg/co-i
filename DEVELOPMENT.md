# Development Journey: AI Experimentation Platform

> **Project Goal**: Build a unified platform for AI model experimentation and deployment that teaches practical AI implementation skills through hands-on building.

## üéØ What This Project Teaches

Building this platform hits multiple capabilities from the AI skills checklist:

- **Call an AI model API** ‚úì Basic provider integration
- **Create prompt versioning and A/B testing** ‚úì Experiment management system  
- **Implement AI-as-judge evaluation** ‚úì Automated scoring and comparison
- **Call a tool with an AI** ‚úì Function calling support
- **Set up comprehensive AI observability/tracing** ‚úì Monitoring and analytics
- **Build multi-model comparison system** ‚úì Cross-provider evaluation

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation - Get Something Working

**Goal**: Make your first successful AI API call and understand the basics

#### Hello AI World
Start as simple as possible:
- Create one Python file
- Make one successful OpenAI API call  
- Print the response
- Calculate the cost
- Understand what happened

**Cursor Composer Prompt**:
```
Create a simple Python script that:
1. Calls OpenAI's API with a test prompt
2. Handles errors gracefully
3. Prints the response
4. Calculates and displays the cost based on tokens used
Include comments explaining each step.
```

#### Basic Provider Abstraction
- Implement base provider class
- Create OpenAI provider
- Add error handling and retries
- Track usage and costs

**Learning Focus**: 
- How AI APIs actually work
- Token counting and pricing
- Error handling patterns
- Async programming basics

**Apply at Work**:
- Use this pattern for Chase's internal AI APIs
- Share error handling approach with team
- Apply cost tracking to department budgets

### Phase 2: Core Platform - Multiple Providers

**Goal**: Abstract away provider differences and enable experimentation

#### Multi-Provider Support
- Add Anthropic (Claude) integration
- Create provider factory pattern
- Standardize request/response formats
- Handle provider-specific quirks

**Cursor Composer Prompt**:
```
Extend the AI provider system to:
1. Support both OpenAI and Anthropic
2. Use a factory pattern to instantiate providers
3. Standardize the interface so switching providers requires no code changes
4. Include provider-specific configuration handling
```

#### Experiment Framework
- Design experiment data model
- Create experiment runner
- Implement result storage
- Add basic comparison logic

**Learning Focus**:
- Provider API differences
- Factory pattern in practice
- Database design for AI data
- Batch processing strategies

**Apply at Work**:
- Integrate Chase's proprietary AI services
- Run experiments comparing vendor models
- Document provider capabilities for team

### Phase 3: Advanced Features - Real Experimentation

**Goal**: Build tools for systematic prompt engineering and evaluation

#### Prompt Management
- Create prompt templates with variables
- Implement version control for prompts
- Build A/B testing framework
- Add prompt optimization tools

**Cursor Composer Prompt**:
```
Build a prompt management system with:
1. Template support with variable substitution
2. Version tracking for all prompt changes
3. A/B testing capability to compare prompt versions
4. Metrics to measure prompt effectiveness
Store everything in the database with full history.
```

#### Evaluation System
- Implement automated scoring
- Add AI-as-judge evaluation
- Create custom metrics
- Build comparison dashboards

**Learning Focus**:
- Prompt engineering at scale
- Quantifying AI output quality
- Statistical testing for AI
- Building evaluation pipelines

**Apply at Work**:
- Test customer service prompts
- Optimize document processing prompts
- Create evaluation framework for compliance

### Phase 4: Production Ready - Professional Polish

**Goal**: Make it deployable and usable by others

#### Web Interface
- Create React frontend
- Build experiment dashboard
- Add real-time updates
- Implement result visualization

**Cursor Composer Prompt**:
```
Create a React TypeScript frontend that:
1. Lists all experiments and their status
2. Shows real-time progress for running experiments
3. Displays results with charts comparing models
4. Allows creating new experiments through forms
Use modern React patterns and make it responsive.
```

#### Infrastructure & Monitoring
- Dockerize everything
- Add comprehensive logging
- Implement monitoring/alerting
- Create deployment scripts

**Learning Focus**:
- Full-stack AI applications
- Production deployment patterns
- Monitoring AI systems
- Security for AI APIs

**Apply at Work**:
- Deploy internal experimentation platform
- Set up monitoring for AI usage
- Create dashboards for leadership

## üß† Learning Notes

### Key Discoveries
*Document insights as you build*

### Challenges Faced
*Track problems and solutions*

### Patterns Identified
*Reusable approaches you discover*

## ü§î Open Questions

### Technical
- How to handle streaming responses across providers?
- Best approach for caching AI responses in development?
- Optimal batch sizing for concurrent requests?

### Product
- What experiment visualizations are most valuable?
- How detailed should cost tracking be?
- What integrations would make this most useful?

## üí° Design Decisions

### Decision: Start with SQLite
**Why**: Zero configuration for local development
**Trade-off**: Will need migration path to PostgreSQL
**Alternative**: Could use PostgreSQL from start with Docker

### Decision: Provider-Agnostic from Day One
**Why**: Avoid rewriting when adding providers
**Trade-off**: More complex initial implementation
**Alternative**: Could hardcode OpenAI first

*Add decisions as you make them*

## üöÄ Quick Wins

Things you can apply immediately at work:
1. Provider abstraction pattern
2. Cost tracking implementation
3. Error handling approach
4. Experiment tracking schema

**Remember**: 
- Start simple, get it working, then improve
- Document decisions and learnings as you go
- Each phase should produce something you can use at work
- It's okay to revisit and refactor earlier phases
